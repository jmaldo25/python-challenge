# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background

In this homework assignment, I will be using the concepts you've learned to complete two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where my newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy.

## PyBank

* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

	* My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

	* The total number of months included in the dataset

	* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

	* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

	* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

	* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.


## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

	* The total number of votes cast

	* A complete list of candidates who received votes

	* The percentage of votes each candidate won
 
	* The total number of votes each candidate won

	* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
